# IP to Location datasource extension

This is a quick and dirty datasource that will send the client's IP to ipinfodb.com to get location data, including
IP, country code, countryname, regioncode, regionname, city, zip, lat, lon, etc.

##Status

I just banged this out today. If it doesn't work, or you need something added to it,[let me know](mailto:andrew@andrewshooner.com)!.
